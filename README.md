CramBot Discord bot
======================

Crambot is a util discord bot that is currently deprecated, since im working on a rewrite, thats why im publishing the old one. Please do not complain about the shitty code of some classes. This used to be my frist ever java project

# Requirements
If you want to make it work, you can edit the stuff you need at the Constants class, that will change the config of the bot, since im too lazy to create one now. For the token, you can change the "TOKEN.token" from the Main class (line 33) to the actual token surrounded with "".

I dont think its necessary to say that you will need java installed on the machine

# How to contribute (Windows/Linux)
First, you will need to clone the repository, to do that open `cmd`/`terminal` and type `git clone https://github.com/UnzorZ/CramBot-java-edition.git`. 
That will clone the repository in the folder you were at the moment. Keep in mind that you will need to have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed in your pc.

Then open the folder with your preferred IDE, in my case, I use Intellij. Then make the changes you want and build it typing in the IDE terminal `./gradlew build`. Try it and if it works,
and you want your changes in the project, open a **Pull Request** and i will check it out.
